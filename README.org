* Aard2 for Android
  /Aard2 for Android/ is a successor to [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=aarddict.android][Aard Dictionary for Android]]. It
  comes with redesigned user interface, bookmarks, history and a
  better [[https://github.com/itkach/slob][dictionary storage format]].

** Developing

  Aard2 is built with [[http://www.gradle.org][Gradle]], make sure to install it first (Gradle
  1.x, Android tools don't work with 2.x yet).

  Aard2 depends on projects [[https://github.com/itkach/fdrawable][fdrawable]], [[https://github.com/itkach/slobj][slobj]] and [[https://github.com/itkach/slobber][slobber]].

  Get the source code:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   mkdir aard2
   cd aard2
   git clone https://github.com/itkach/fdrawable.git
   git clone https://github.com/itkach/slobj.git
   git clone https://github.com/itkach/slobber.git
   git clone https://github.com/itkach/aard2-android.git
   #+END_SRC

   Create /settings.gradle/ with the following content:

   #+BEGIN_SRC groovy
   include ':fdrawable'
   include ':slobj'
   include ':slobber'
   include ':aard2-android'
   #+END_SRC

   Open [[https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html][Android Studio]], go to /File/, /Import Project.../, select
   /aard2/ directory and then /Finish/. This should create the project
   ready for running and debugging on device or in emulator.
