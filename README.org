** Launching from Other Applications

   Aard 2 lookup can be initiated from other applications, either
   through standard /Share/ action or directly, if application
   implemented an action to start Aard 2 with lookup intent.

   Applications can launch Aard 2 lookup by starting activity with intent
   ~aard2.lookup~ with text to look up passed as an extra string
    parameter [[http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/SearchManager.html#QUERY][SearchManager.QUERY]]. For example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC java
   Intent intent = new Intent("aard2.lookup");
   intent.putExtra(SearchManager.QUERY, "Foo Bar");
   startActivity(intent);
   #+END_SRC

   Same thing from a command line using /adb/:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   adb shell am start -a aard2.lookup -e query "Foo Bar"
   #+END_SRC


** Developing

  Aard 2 is built with [[http://www.gradle.org][Gradle]], make sure to install it first (Gradle
  1.x, Android tools don't work with 2.x yet).

  Aard 2 depends on projects [[https://github.com/itkach/fdrawable][fdrawable]], [[https://github.com/itkach/slobj][slobj]] and [[https://github.com/itkach/slobber][slobber]].

  Get the source code:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   mkdir aard2
   cd aard2
   git clone https://github.com/itkach/fdrawable.git
   git clone https://github.com/itkach/slobj.git
   git clone https://github.com/itkach/slobber.git
   git clone https://github.com/itkach/aard2-android.git
   #+END_SRC

   Create /settings.gradle/ with the following content:

   #+BEGIN_SRC groovy
   include ':fdrawable'
   include ':slobj'
   include ':slobber'
   include ':aard2-android'
   #+END_SRC

   Open [[https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html][Android Studio]], go to /File/, /Import Project.../, select
   /aard2/ directory and then /Finish/. This should create the project
   ready for running and debugging on device or in emulator.

   To build an APK on the command line:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd aard2-android
   gradle build
   #+END_SRC

   To install the APK:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   adb install -r build/outputs/apk/aard2-android-debug.apk
   #+END_SRC
